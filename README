Language 'mekso' was created with parrot/tools/dev/create_language.pl, r38376.

    mekso is an experimental language based on Lojban, the Logical Language.
(See http://www.lojban.org/ for more information about the language.)

    It is not intended to be able to parse or interpret every possible Lojban
utterance. Indeed, its grammar is necessarily more restrictive than the
official grammar of Lojban. It's targetted at supporting most of the mekso
subgrammar, as well as some non-mekso features that are intended to assist in
the use of the language.

    Here is a list of what's supported right now:

    Numbers in any base up to 16, including floating point. This amounts to PA1 and PA2 plus "pi", "ma'u" and "ni'u". Anything else from PA is not supported.

    Operators, either in infix or Polish Notation. RPN isn't supported yet.

    * VUhU1 is supported (su'i, vu'u, pi'i, fe'i)
    * Most of VUhU2 is supported (fa'i, gei, te'a, ju'u)
    * VUhU3 is supported (cu'a, de'o, fe'a, ne'o, va'a)
    * VUhU4 is not supported at all (And probably won't be for some time.)

    mekso does not yet understand multiple operator strings (e.g. "pa su'i re
pi'i ci") unless you use explicit parens ("vei ... ve'o").

    One selbri for general use:

    cusku, which prints the se cusku to stdout. Any other specified places are
ignored for now.

    Two selbri for use with Test Anything Protocol:

    cipra, accompanied by a mei, is used at the start of a test script to 
specify how many tests are coming.

    dunxu'a, accompanied by a mai indicating which test is being performed. 
dunxu'a compares the se dunxu'a and the te dunxu'a and prints "ok" if they are 
equal or "not ok" if they are not.
    
    It is possible to include a mei or mai for any bridi, but unless mentioned 
above, they'll be ignored.
